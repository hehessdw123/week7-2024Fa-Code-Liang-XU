    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>The first web page was written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures content on the web, allowing browsers to display text, images, and other elements.</p>

    <h3>How to use HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. Elements can include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.</p>
    <p>HTML documents are structured with a basic layout, including a HEAD section for metadata and a BODY section for content.</p>
